## Summary
Here are the answers to your flight simulator terrain LOD questions:

### **Q1: Maximum Geometric Error at 5km (1 pixel threshold)**
**Answer: 1.0264 meters** (approximately 1.03m)

At 5km distance with your setup (1024px vertical resolution, 12° VFov), the viewing frustum height is 1051m, giving you 1.0264 meters per pixel. Any terrain geometric error larger than this will be visible on screen.

***

### **Q2: Modifying SSE Formula for Grazing Angles**
The perspective-corrected SSE formula accounts for foreshortening of vertical errors when viewing at an angle:

```
SSE (pixels) = (GeometricError × cos(pitch) × VerticalResolution) / (2 × D × tan(VFov/2))
```

**Key modification:** Multiply the geometric error by **cos(pitch)** where pitch is your camera angle (negative when looking down).

***

### **Q3: Does Grazing Angle Allow Lower LODs Sooner?**
**Yes, but the benefit at -12° is modest (~2% tolerance increase).**

- At **-12° pitch**: You can tolerate 1.02× larger geometric errors
- At **-30° pitch**: 1.15× larger errors (15% benefit)
- At **-45° pitch**: 1.41× larger errors (41% benefit) 
- At **-60° pitch**: 2.00× larger errors (100% benefit!)

The projected error decreases as **cos(pitch)**, so steeper viewing angles provide substantial LOD savings. For typical flight sim scenarios with moderate pitch angles, implement this—you'll get significant benefits during low-altitude flight and terrain banking.

***

### **Q4: Perspective-Corrected SSE Formula for LOD Selection**
**Complete formula:**

```
GeometricError_max(D, pitch) = (D × K) / cos(pitch)

Where: K = 2 × tan(VFov/2) / VerticalResolution
```

**For your specific configuration:**
```
K = 0.00020528
GeometricError_max(D, pitch) = (D × 0.00020528) / cos(pitch)
```

**Pseudocode implementation:**
```cpp
// Pre-calculate constant
const float K = 2.0f * tan(VFov / 2.0f) / VerticalResolution;

int SelectLOD(float distance, float pitchAngle) {
    float cosPitch = cos(pitchAngle);
    float maxGeoError = (distance * K) / cosPitch;
    
    // Select LOD with geometric error ≤ maxGeoError
    for (int lod = 0; lod < numLODs; lod++) {
        if (lodGeometricErrors[lod] <= maxGeoError) {
            return lod;
        }
    }
    return lowestDetailLOD;
}
```

The visualization above shows how LOD transition distances change with pitch angle and how foreshortening benefits scale with viewing angle. This approach is definitely worth implementing for flight simulators!
